# DefectDetection-MaskRCNN
Defects Detection with Mask R-CNN

This project is a continued effort to analyze STEM images automatically for material science. 

We goes from bounding box level to the pixel level segmentation.

Use the datasets/ellipse/drawellipsejson.ipynb to generate JSON file that contains information of the loops in the images. And then move the generated json file to the train folder that contains all the train images. Then use the inspect_balloon_data.ipynb to visualize the labels by applying watershed algorithms.
