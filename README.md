# DefectDetection-MaskRCNN
Defects Detection with Mask R-CNN

This project is a continued effort to analyze STEM images automatically for material science. 

We goes from bounding box level to the pixel level segmentation.

Use the datasets/balloon/defectextraction1 to generate JSON file that contains information of the loops in the images. And then use the inspect_balloon_data.ipynb to visualize the labels by applying watershed algorithms.
